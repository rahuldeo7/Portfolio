Hello! I'm Rahul Deo, from Chennai, India.

I am a graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas, majoring in Business Analytics with a concentration in Data Science. With a solid foundation in Python, C, C++, SQL, and R, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights using dedicated Python libraries. My expertise spans supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and Databricks.

I excel in data visualization with tools like Tableau and PowerBI, and enjoy exploring and performing feature engineering to uncover deep insights.

I am a creative, time punctual, dedicated, goal-oriented individual with decent moral Values and Ethicates along with a high-energy level, honed communication skills, strong organizational skills, and meticulous attention to detail.

I am a member of [Developer Student Club - SVVV](https://dsc.community.dev/shri-vaishnav-vidyapeeth-vishwavidyalaya/) and have also been awarded 75% Merit Scholarship(Top 10%) by my college.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
